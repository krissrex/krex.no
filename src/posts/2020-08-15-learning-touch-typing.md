I just got a new keyboard: [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/nb-no/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00026) with Norwegian layout.  
I couldn't find any good prices online, so I bought a used one from [Finn](https://finn.no).
It seems this keyboard is old and out of stock, compared to Microsoft's newer 2019 and Sculpt models.

Previously, I have only used the laptop's keyboard. I developed my own way of typing by years of usage. That way was very incompatible with my new keyboard, as the keys are split on the middle of the keyboard into two groups.

So the logical conclusion was to relearn typing, and to do it properly this time.
I started by looking for good, online training sites and found these:
* [typingclub.com](https://www.typingclub.com/)
* [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/)
* [speedcoder.net](HTTP://www.speedcoder.net/) (**No https!** - don't enter any passwords on this site)
* [ratatype.com](https://www.ratatype.com/)
* [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/)
* [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/)

Next, I did a minute of practice on [keybr](keybr.com), followed by a test on [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/). I tried both with touch, and with my laptop and the homegrown method. 
My old way of typing was already feeling strange; crazy how fast muscle memory fades!  
Here are the results:

My old method would probably have been 5-10 words faster if I did the test before starting to learn touch, and the touch method would be slower. Anyways, this will serve as a benchmark for the future.

## Comparing the websites

The first thing I notice is that few support the Norwegian/Scandinavian keyboard layout.
Those that do are [typingclub](https://typingclub.com), [typing](https://typing.com) and [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com). However, using Norwegian keyboard on [typing](https://typing.com) still showed an American layout.

Next is the user interface. [typingclub](https://typingclub.com), [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net) and [typing](https://typing.com) have a nice keyboard UI that also shows what fingers to use. Ratatype has a color coded keyboard but no fingers.

Gamification is present on [typingclub](https://typingclub.com) and [typing](https://typing.com) in the form of minigames and scores. Both [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) and [keybr](https://keybr.com) has multiplayer in the form of a race car game.

[Ratatype](https://ratatype.com) requires signup before you can use it.

[10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) and [keybr](https://keybr.com) uses words to teach you. [Keybr](https://keybr.com) is also dynamically adjusting what words you get, based on your performance. The others have you type `fjfj ffjj ffff jjjf ffjf` a lot, which prevents you from memorizing words. I think memorizing words is a good thing. [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) also has Norwegian (and other languages) words, which is good. We use a lot of <kbd>Æ</kbd>, <kbd>Ø</kbd> and <kbd>Å</kbd> which also needs to be practiced. [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net) is different from all the others, by using programming languages as the source of training text. This lets you practice common symbols like <kbd>(</kbd>, <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>;</kbd>.

[10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) and [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net) do not ease you into touch by adding more and more letters. Instead you have to use every key from the start. The other sites are structured more like a course, gradually ramping up the difficulty. [typing](https://typing.com) has a video introduction for each course.

Not all sites encourage you to use <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, which is a shame. If there is anything a touch-noob like me needs, it is the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key! [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) and [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net) are the only ones where you can erase your mistakes. The others will simply go to the next letter.

Combination keys like <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> are shown on [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net), indicating which finger to use for the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key.

## My choice of site
It's a hard choice. They all have their strengths. I will be using [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) to measure my speed. I might use [typingclub](https://typingclub.com) to learn finger and key placements. And I will use [keybr](https://keybr.com) and [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com) to get my speed and accuracy up, as their words are dynamic and Norwegian respectively.

Eventually, I might throw in some [speedcoder](HTTP://speedcoder.net) and [typing](https://typing.com) to write code and practice symbol characters.
