# A salute to coffee

I stumbled upon a song about coffee.
A 1991 documentary about two 90 year old brothers,
from Sauda (see map below) featured a scene
where the eldest brother sang a song about coffee.

I didn't find the song anywhere online, and I quite liked it.
So to preserve the text, I put on my archivist's hat and captured the text here.
It would be beneficial to capture the melody as well, but that's a task for someone else.


> Du gode, varme og vennekjære
> du kaffidrope som so godt oss gjere!
>
> Du klårar tanken, gjer underverk.
> og luktar herleg når du er sterk.
>
> Du kveikjker hugnad og kvesser ordet,
> set liv i laget kring kaffibordet.
>
> Du døyver vondskap og hovudverk,
> og tenner varme i brok og serk.

## English version

I tried translating it. The goal is not to create a version you can sing,
or one that rhymes.
It's just so non-Norwegian speakers get an idea of what it is about.

> You good, warm and friendly
> you drop of coffee that does us so well!
>
> You clear thoughts,
> do wonders.
> And smell delicious
> when you are strong.
>
> You refresh memory and sharpen the tongue,
> liven up the crowd around the coffee table.
>
> You numb pain and headache,
> and light a heat in pants and shirts.
